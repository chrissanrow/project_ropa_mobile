### Summary

This is a React Native + Expo mobile project intended to support the needs of Project Ropa (NOTE: as of 5/18/25, Project Ropa has decided not to utilize this service). The app allows donors to track their donations using a QR code based system and add new items through a scanner in app. On the admin side, the nonprofit can update the item status at each point of the distribution process and generate new QR codes for new items.

### Motivation

Project Ropa is a nonprofit organization that distributes donated clothing items and hygiene kits through their mobile closet. Currently, they have no way for donors to keep track of the status of their donated items and no effective way to deal with duplicate entries. The NPO desired a mobile solution that addresses these issues. Our team connected with Project Ropa's mission to not only serve our collective community, but do so sustainably and reduce textile waste in this age of fast fashion. We used the themes of the Project Ropa website to create a mobile application that addresses their problem statement, but also align with their image and be easily modified to fit their goals.

### How to Build

Since Project Ropa has decided not to go through with this application, it is currently not being deployed. However, you can still simulate it by cloning / forking the repository:

 - run npm i within the top-level directory
 - run npx expo --tunnel
 - simulate using one of the provided options
